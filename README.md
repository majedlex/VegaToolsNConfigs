Monero(XMR) has forked to RandomX and all Vega 56/64/FE hashrates reported in this site are cut in half.
AFAIK, xmrig and XMR-STAK-RX miners are working with RandomX.

Since power consumption so much lower and hash rate is much higher with CPU(s), I advise not to mine monero with Vega GPU(s).


Before 12/01/2019

AMD Vega GPU tools and configuration file(s) mostly for Monero(XMR) mining.
I will be expanding to other miners/coins/algos/gpus but the main focus will be for XMR and Vega+ GPUs.


# NOTE:

Confusing terms:

Depending on the miner, pool...etc the folloing will be used interchangeably.

Cryptonight r AKA cn/r AKA CNr AKA CNv4

Cryptonight rwz AKA cn/rwz AKA CNrwz AKA Cryptonight V8 ReverseWaltz

Crpytonight R and ReverseWaltz:

cast-xmr: development has stopped and CNr and CNrwz will not be supported.

xmrig-amd: Version 2.14.0-2.14.4 work on ALL VEGA GPUs under amdgpu-pro 18.30/18.40/18.50 with CNr(XMR) and CNrwz(GRAFT).

xmrig-amd: Version 2.14.0-2.14.4 work on Radeon VII under amdgpu-pro 19.10 with CNr(XMR) and CNrwz(GRAFT).

xmr-stak: Testing version 2.10.0/1/2/3/4/5.(Getting "AMD Invalid Result GPU ID 0" for pre-compiled binaries and native binaries)

teamredminer: Version 0.4.2-0.5.2 beta work on ALL VEGA GPUs under amdgpu-pro 18.30/18.40/18.50 with CNr(XMR) and CNrwz(GRAFT).

teamredminer: Version 0.4.2-0.5.2 beta work on Radeon VII under amdgpu-pro 19.10 with CNr(XMR) and 
CNrwz(GRAFT).

Cryptonight V8:

The xmrig-amd and xmr-stark cryptonight V8 miners will not work with amdgpu-pro 18.30/18.40/18.50 drivers alone so you have to use them in conjuction with 18.10.  However, they will work with ROCm 1.9.1+ with low hash rate.  All miners(cast-xmr/teamredminer/xmrig-amd/xmr-stak) have the very close hash rates on ALL VEGA GPUs under amdgpu-pro 18.10/18.30/18.40/18.50.  ROCm 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 are still stuck with lower hash rates.

Cryptonight V7:

VegaUbuntuGuide will work with most cryptonight V7 coins at Windows level hash rate(s).

# Tips and Tricks
For CNv2 - If you have many rigs with the same type of Vega cards, follow the guide with one rig and tar up the xmrig-amd or xmr-stak and .openclcache directories.  On the other rig(s) just install amdgpu-pro 18.30/18.40/18.50 and copy the tar file from the first rig and untar them in ~/git directory and run the miners.  Dont' forget the ~/.openclcache if you are using xmr-stak.
